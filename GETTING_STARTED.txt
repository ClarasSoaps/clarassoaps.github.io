   - lemongrass-exfoliating.jpg
   - cucumber-melon.jpg
   - peppermint.jpg
   - sugar-cookie.jpg
   - christmas-wreath.jpg
3. Add a photo of yourself as "clara-portrait.jpg" for the About page
4. Create a simple placeholder.jpg (any plain soap image) as a fallback

2. Test all features:
   - Browse the shop
